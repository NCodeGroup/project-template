## Plan in a worktree of its own

Each plan lives in its own git worktree, so several Claude Code sessions can plan and execute different plans on this machine at once. Executing, re-planning and reviewing this plan later happen in the same worktree. Set it up before you read any code, so your research matches the code the executor will change:

1. Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. If the path contains `/.claude/worktrees/`, this session is already in a worktree: use it, unless its `PLAN.md` has a step not yet marked `[x]`. In that case stop, because the worktree holds a plan in progress, and tell me to start the new plan from a new session in the main checkout.
2. Otherwise, if `git check-ignore -q .claude/worktrees/` exits non-zero, append the line `.claude/worktrees/` to `info/exclude` in the folder that `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir` prints, so the main checkout doesn't list worktrees as untracked files.
3. Then name the worktree: two to four lowercase words from the request, joined by hyphens, such as `csv-export`, and not already a folder under `.claude/worktrees/`. Create the worktree and switch into it with the `EnterWorktree` tool and that `name`.
4. A worktree is a fresh checkout, without ignored files such as installed dependencies. If the build or test command needs a setup step first, such as `npm ci`, run it in the worktree and list it under Context for the executor.

From here on, the repository root is the worktree's root: read, write and run commands only there, never in the main checkout.

After writing `PLAN.md`, commit it in the worktree: `git add PLAN.md`, then `git commit -m "Plan: <the plan's title>"`. End your reply with the worktree's name and branch, and how to continue: `/orchestrate-plan` in this session; from a new session, `/orchestrate-plan <name>`; or from a terminal, `claude --worktree <name>` and then `/orchestrate-plan`. If Claude Code asks on exit whether to keep the worktree, keep it.

## Task

Plan documentation for:

$ARGUMENTS

1. Identify the audience and what they need to accomplish with the documentation.
2. Read the code being documented, so every fact in the plan is accurate: names, defaults, options, error behavior, examples that run.
3. List each document or section to write or update, with the facts it must contain. The executor writes the prose; you supply the facts.
4. Point at an existing document whose structure and tone to follow.
5. Make each Done-when objective: the file exists, it contains the required headings (`Select-String`), links resolve, or the docs build passes.

## Output: PLAN.md for the executor model

Write the result to `PLAN.md` in the repository root. Change no other file.

A smaller, cheaper model — a local model or a lower-cost Copilot model — will execute this plan one step at a time. It sees only `PLAN.md` and the files it opens — not this conversation, not your research. It follows instructions literally, loses track in long or vague steps, and cannot make design decisions. Write for that reader:

- Resolve every design decision here, in the plan. A step must never say "decide", "choose", "consider" or "as appropriate".
- Give each step 1–3 files. Name exact paths, functions, classes, signatures and data shapes.
- Point at existing code to imitate ("follow the pattern of `parseLog()` in `src/log.ts`") instead of describing a style.
- Show a short code sketch only where the shape is not obvious (a signature, a type, a tricky expression), never a full implementation.
- Order steps so each one builds and passes its check on its own. Put tests before or with the code they cover.
- Every step ends with one PowerShell command, run from the repository root, that exits 0 only when the step is done and finishes in under two minutes. Prefer a check that fails until the step is done — run the step's new test by name, or assert the new output — over a suite that already passes.
- Keep each step under about 25 lines. Split anything bigger.
- Expect escalations: when a step needs a decision the plan didn't make, the executor stops, marks it `[?]` with an `- Escalation:` note, and the step comes back to you for re-planning. Every escalation costs a round trip, so settle decisions now.

Use exactly this structure; the step runner parses the `### [ ] N.` headings and the `- Done when:` lines:

```markdown
# Plan: <title, 2-10 words>

## Goal
<What changes for the user or system, and why. 2-4 sentences.>

## Context for the executor
- Build: `<command>`
- Test: `<command>`
- Conventions: <naming, error handling, logging, formatting rules the code must follow>
- Gotchas: <anything surprising about this codebase that a newcomer would get wrong>

## Decisions
- <Each design decision made, with a one-line reason.>

## Out of scope
- <Changes the executor must not make, even if they look helpful.>

## Steps

### [ ] 1. <imperative title>
- Files: `<path>` (edit), `<path>` (new)
- Change: <exactly what to add, change or remove; reference symbols by name>
- Pattern: <existing code to imitate, if any>
- Done when: `<single PowerShell command that exits 0 on success>`

### [ ] 2. <imperative title>
...

## Review checklist
- <What the reviewer must confirm beyond the Done-when checks: behavior, edge cases, compatibility, performance.>
```

After writing `PLAN.md`, reply with the step list (one line per step) and any open risks. Do not start implementing.
