Plan this refactor so that behavior does not change:

$ARGUMENTS

1. Describe the current structure, the target structure, and the problem the refactor solves.
2. Find every caller and dependent of the code being moved or renamed — search the whole repository, including tests, scripts, configuration and reflection-style string references.
3. Check test coverage of the affected behavior. If it is thin, the first steps add characterization tests that pin the current behavior.
4. Sequence the change so the build and tests stay green after every step: add the new structure, move callers over in small groups, then delete the old structure.
5. Every step's Done-when runs the full relevant test suite, not only new tests.
6. Under Out of scope, forbid behavior changes, renames beyond the plan, and formatting-only churn.

## Output: PLAN.md for the executor model

Write the result to `PLAN.md` in the repository root. Change no other file.

A smaller, cheaper model — a local model or a lower-cost Copilot model — will execute this plan one step at a time. It sees only `PLAN.md` and the files it opens — not this conversation, not your research. It follows instructions literally, loses track in long or vague steps, and cannot make design decisions. Write for that reader:

- Resolve every design decision here, in the plan. A step must never say "decide", "choose", "consider" or "as appropriate".
- Give each step 1–3 files. Name exact paths, functions, classes, signatures and data shapes.
- Point at existing code to imitate ("follow the pattern of `parseLog()` in `src/log.ts`") instead of describing a style.
- Show a short code sketch only where the shape is not obvious (a signature, a type, a tricky expression), never a full implementation.
- Order steps so each one builds and passes its check on its own. Put tests before or with the code they cover.
- Every step ends with one PowerShell command, run from the repository root, that exits 0 only when the step is done and finishes in under two minutes. Prefer a check that fails until the step is done — run the step's new test by name, or assert the new output — over a suite that already passes.
- Keep each step under about 25 lines. Split anything bigger.
- Expect escalations: when a step needs a decision the plan didn't make, the executor stops, marks it `[?]` with an `- Escalation:` note, and the step comes back to you for re-planning. Every escalation costs a round trip, so settle decisions now.

Use exactly this structure; the step runner parses the `### [ ] N.` headings and the `- Done when:` lines:

```markdown
# Plan: <title, 2-10 words>

## Goal
<What changes for the user or system, and why. 2-4 sentences.>

## Context for the executor
- Build: `<command>`
- Test: `<command>`
- Conventions: <naming, error handling, logging, formatting rules the code must follow>
- Gotchas: <anything surprising about this codebase that a newcomer would get wrong>

## Decisions
- <Each design decision made, with a one-line reason.>

## Out of scope
- <Changes the executor must not make, even if they look helpful.>

## Steps

### [ ] 1. <imperative title>
- Files: `<path>` (edit), `<path>` (new)
- Change: <exactly what to add, change or remove; reference symbols by name>
- Pattern: <existing code to imitate, if any>
- Done when: `<single PowerShell command that exits 0 on success>`

### [ ] 2. <imperative title>
...

## Review checklist
- <What the reviewer must confirm beyond the Done-when checks: behavior, edge cases, compatibility, performance.>
```

After writing `PLAN.md`, reply with the step list (one line per step) and any open risks. Do not start implementing.
