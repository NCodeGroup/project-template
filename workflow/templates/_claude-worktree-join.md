## Work in the plan's worktree

Each plan lives in its own git worktree, so several Claude Code sessions can work on different plans on this machine at once. Before anything else, move this session to the plan:

1. Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. If the path contains `/.claude/worktrees/` and has a `PLAN.md`, this session is in the plan's worktree: go on with the task.
2. Otherwise list the plan worktrees: run `git worktree list --porcelain`, keep each `worktree` path under `.claude/worktrees/` that has a `PLAN.md`, and read each plan's title from its first line.
3. Choose the plan, in this order: the worktree whose folder name the command's arguments give; else the only plan worktree; else, when there is no plan worktree, the `PLAN.md` in the current checkout, worked on where it is — a plan written without a worktree, such as in Copilot. Switch into a chosen worktree with the `EnterWorktree` tool and its `path`. With several plan worktrees and none named, list them with their titles and stop to ask which one. With no plan anywhere, stop and say so.

From here on, the plan's folder is the repository root: run every command there, Done-when commands included. In a worktree, never edit files or run git in the main checkout. When you delegate to a subagent, give it the folder's absolute path and tell it to work only there.
